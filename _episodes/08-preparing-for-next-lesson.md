# Lesson

## Transforming and Selecting a Subset of the Data
Sometimes you would like to export a file that only contains a subset of the data in your project that conforms to a specific standard.  

In the next module of this course we will submit sequencing data to the repository ENA and we need to prepare sample metadata to conform to the metadata standards of the repository.

We need to consider the following questions:

- Which of the existing columns are relevant for the submission?
- Are they named correctly?
- Are there additional columns that need to be added?

## Exporting Cleaned Data

You can also export just your cleaned data, rather than the entire project.

1. Click `Export` in the top right and select the file type you want to export the data in. In this case we will choose `Comma-separated values` (`csv`).
2. That file will be exported to your default `Download` directory. That file can then be opened in a spreadsheet program or imported
into programs like RStudio which we'll be discussing later in our workshop.

Remember from our lesson on data organisation that using widely-supported, non-proprietary file formats like `tsv` or `csv` improves the ability of yourself and others to use your data.
